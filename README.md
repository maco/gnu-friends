# GNU/Friends

If you're a Friend (Quaker) and Free/Open Source Software hacker, send a pull

## Why "GNU/Friends"?

It's a joke on the insistence of [Richard Stallman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Stallman)
that the term "GNU/Linux" be used instead of simply "Linux" for operating system
distributions. "Friend" is in there because the official name for Quakerism is
the Religious Society of Friends.
